%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

 widely used to assess the accuracy of prediction algorithms, from raw
 percentages, quadratic error measures and other distances, and
 correlation coefficients, and to information theoretic measures such
 as relative entropy and mutual information. We briefly discuss the
 advantages and disadvantages of each approach. For classification
 tasks, we derive new learning algorithms for the design of prediction
 systems by directly optimising the correlation coefficient. We
 observe and prove several results relating sensitivity and
 specificity of optimal systems. While the principles are general, we
 illustrate the applicability on specific problems such as protein
 secondary structure and signal peptide prediction. Contact: pfbaldi@ics.uci.edu}",

    abstract = { Conspiracy theories started to appear on social media immediately after the first news about COVID-19. Is the virus a hoax? Is it a bioweapon designed in a Chinese laboratory? These conspiracy theories typically have an intergroup flavour, blaming one group for having some involvement in either manufacturing the virus or controlling public opinion about it. In this article, I will discuss why people are attracted to conspiracy theories in general, and why conspiracy theories seem to have flourished during the pandemic. I will discuss what the consequences of these conspiracy theories are for individuals, groups, and societies. I will then discuss some potential strategies for addressing the negative consequences of conspiracy theories. Finally, I will consider some open questions for research regarding COVID-19 conspiracy theories, in particular focusing on the potential impact of these conspiracy theories for group processes and intergroup relations. }

A corpus of 1,627 articles from 9 political publishers, three each from the mainstream, the hyperpartisan left, and the hyperpartisan right, have been fact-checked by professional journalists at BuzzFeed: 97{\%} of the 299 fake news articles identified are also hyperpartisan. We show how a style analysis can distinguish hyperpartisan news from the mainstream (F1 = 0.78), and satire from both (F1 = 0.81). But stylometry is no silver bullet as style-based fake news detection does not work (F1 = 0.46). We further reveal that left-wing and right-wing news share significantly more stylistic similarities than either does with the mainstream. This result is robust: it has been confirmed by three different modeling approaches, one of which employs Unmasking in a novel way. Applications of our results include partisanship detection and pre-screening for semi-automatic fake news detection.",

    abstract = "Fake news spreading through media outlets poses a real threat to the trustworthiness of information and detecting fake news has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Fake news is typically written intentionally to mislead readers, which determines that fake news detection merely based on news content is tremendously challenging. Meanwhile, fake news could contain true evidence to mock true news and presents different degrees of fakeness, which further exacerbates the detection difficulty. On the other hand, the spread of fake news produces various types of data from different perspectives. These multiple sources provide rich contextual information about fake news and offer unprecedented opportunities for advanced fake news detection. In this paper, we study fake news detection with different degrees of fakeness by integrating multiple sources. In particular, we introduce approaches to combine information from multiple sources and to discriminate between different degrees of fakeness, and propose a Multi-source Multi-class Fake news Detection framework MMFD, which combines automated feature extraction, multi-source fusion and automated degrees of fakeness detection into a coherent and interpretable model. Experimental results on the real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and extensive experiments are further conducted to understand the working of the proposed framework.",

    abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;Social media has become one of the main channels for people to access and consume news, due to the rapidness and low cost of news dissemination on it. However, such properties of social media also make it a hotbed of fake news dissemination, bringing negative impacts on both individuals and society. Therefore, detecting fake news has become a crucial problem attracting tremendous research effort. Most existing methods of fake news detection are supervised, which require an extensive amount of time and labor to build a reliably annotated dataset. In search of an alternative, in this paper, we investigate if we could detect fake news in an &lt;em&gt;unsupervised&lt;/em&gt; manner. We treat truths of news and users’ credibility as latent random variables, and exploit users’ engagements on social media to identify their opinions towards the authenticity of news. We leverage a Bayesian network model to capture the conditional dependencies among the truths of news, the users’ opinions, and the users’ credibility. To solve the inference problem, we propose an efficient collapsed Gibbs sampling approach to infer the truths of news and the users’ credibility without any labelled data. Experiment results on two datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the compared unsupervised methods.&lt;/p&gt;},

abstract = {The fast spreading of fake news stories on social media can cause inestimable social harm. Developing effective methods to detect them early is of paramount importance. A major challenge of fake news early detection is fully utilizing the limited data observed at the early stage of news propagation and then learning useful patterns from it for identifying fake news. In this article, we propose a novel deep neural network to detect fake news early. It has three novel components: (1) a status-sensitive crowd response feature extractor that extracts both text features and user features from combinations of users’ text response and their corresponding user profiles, (2) a position-aware attention mechanism that highlights important user responses at specific ranking positions, and (3) a multi-region mean-pooling mechanism to perform feature aggregation based on multiple window sizes. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can detect fake news with greater than 90% accuracy within 5 minutes after it starts to spread and before it is retweeted 50 times, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art baselines. Most importantly, our approach requires only 10% labeled fake news samples to achieve this effectiveness under PU-Learning settings.},

While different fact-checking organizations would naturally make different choices when analyzing the same debate, we show that it pays to learn from multiple sources simultaneously (PolitiFact, FactCheck, ABC, CNN, NPR, NYT, Chicago Tribune, The Guardian, and Washington Post) in a multi-task learning setup, even when a particular source is chosen as a target to imitate. Our evaluation shows state-of-the-art results on a standard dataset for the task of check-worthiness prediction.",

As a result and over time, a large number of fact-checked claims have been accumulated, which increases the likelihood that a new claim in social media or a new statement by a politician might have already been fact-checked by some trusted fact-checking organization, as viral claims often come back after a while in social media, and politicians like to repeat their favorite statements, true or false, over and over again. As manual fact-checking is very time-consuming (and fully automatic fact-checking has credibility issues), it is important to try to save this effort and to avoid wasting time on claims that have already been fact-checked. Interestingly, despite the importance of the task, it has been largely ignored by the research community so far. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we formulate the task and we discuss how it relates to, but also differs from, previous work. We further create a specialized dataset, which we release to the research community. Finally, we present learning-to-rank experiments that demonstrate sizable improvements over state-of-the-art retrieval and textual similarity approaches.",

The claims are classified as Supported, Refuted or NotEnoughInfo by annotators achieving 0.6841 in Fleiss kappa. For the first two classes, the annotators also recorded the sentence(s) forming the necessary evidence for their judgment. To characterize the challenge of the dataset presented, we develop a pipeline approach and compare it to suitably designed oracles. The best accuracy we achieve on labeling a claim accompanied by the correct evidence is 31.87{\%}, while if we ignore the evidence we achieve 50.91{\%}. Thus we believe that FEVER is a challenging testbed that will help stimulate progress on claim verification against textual sources.",

In this work, we present a method suitable for reasoning about the semantic-level structure of evidence. Unlike most previous works, which typically represent evidence sentences with either string concatenation or fusing the features of isolated evidence sentences, our approach operates on rich semantic structures of evidence obtained by semantic role labeling. We propose two mechanisms to exploit the structure of evidence while leveraging the advances of pre-trained models like BERT, GPT or XLNet. Specifically, using XLNet as the backbone, we first utilize the graph structure to re-define the relative distances of words, with the intuition that semantically related words should have short distances. Then, we adopt graph convolutional network and graph attention network to propagate and aggregate information from neighboring nodes on the graph. We evaluate our system on FEVER, a benchmark dataset for fact checking, and find that rich structural information is helpful and both our graph-based mechanisms improve the accuracy. Our model is the state-of-the-art system in terms of both official evaluation metrics, namely claim verification accuracy and FEVER score.",

There was a great variety in adversarial attack types as well as the techniques used to generate the attacks, In this paper, we present the results of the shared task and a summary of the systems, highlighting commonalities and innovations among participating systems.",

abstract = {Organizations spend significant amounts of time and money to manually fact check text documents summarizing data. The goal of the Scrutinizer system is to reduce verification overheads by supporting human fact checkers in translating text claims into SQL queries on an database. Scrutinizer coordinates teams of human fact checkers. It reduces verification time by proposing queries or query fragments to the users. Those proposals are based on claim text classifiers, that gradually improve during the verification of a large document. In addition, Scrutinizer uses tentative execution of query candidates to narrow down the set of alternatives. The verification process is controlled by a cost-based optimizer. It optimizes the interaction with users and prioritizes claim verifications. For the latter, it considers expected verification overheads as well as the expected claim utility as training samples for the classifiers. We evaluate the Scrutinizer system using simulations and a user study with professional fact checkers, based on actual claims and data. Our experiments consistently demonstrate significant savings in verification time, without reducing result accuracy.},

Manually validating each fact is time-consuming. Prior work on automating this task relied on numerical confidence scores which might not be easily interpreted. To overcome this limitation, we present Tracy, a novel tool that generates human-comprehensible explanations for candidate facts. Our tool relies on background knowledge in the form of rules to rewrite the fact in question into other easier-to-spot facts. These rewritings are then used to reason over the candidate fact creating semantic traces that can aid KG curators. The goal of our demonstration is to illustrate the main features of our system and to show how the semantic traces can be computed over both text and knowledge graphs with a simple and intuitive user interface. },

Previous research has shown that most of the messages posted on Twitter are truthful, but the service is also used to spread misinformation and false rumors, often unintentionally.On this paper we focus on automatic methods for assessing the credibility of a given set of tweets. Specifically, we analyze microblog postings related to "trending" topics, and classify them as credible or not credible, based on features extracted from them. We use features from users' posting and re-posting ("re-tweeting") behavior, from the text of the posts, and from citations to external sources.We evaluate our methods using a significant number of human assessments about the credibility of items on a recent sample of Twitter postings. Our results shows that there are measurable differences in the way messages propagate, that can be used to classify them automatically as credible or not credible, with precision and recall in the range of 70% to 80%.},

abstract = {Microblogging platforms are an ideal place for spreading rumors and automatically debunking rumors is a crucial problem. To detect rumors, existing approaches have relied on hand-crafted features for employing machine learning algorithms that require daunting manual effort. Upon facing a dubious claim, people dispute its truthfulness by posting various cues over time, which generates long-distance dependencies of evidence. This paper presents a novel method that learns continuous representations of microblog events for identifying rumors. The proposed model is based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) for learning the hidden representations that capture the variation of contextual information of relevant posts over time. Experimental results on datasets from two real-world microblog platforms demonstrate that (1) the RNN method outperforms state-of-the-art rumor detection models that use hand-crafted features; (2) performance of the RNN-based algorithm is further improved via sophisticated recurrent units and extra hidden layers; (3) RNN-based method detects rumors more quickly and accurately than existing techniques, including the leading online rumor debunking services.},

It is therefore important that a shared task in this area continues to provide a focus for effort, which is likely to increase. Rumour verification is characterised by the need to consider evolving conversations and news updates to reach a verdict on a rumour{'}s veracity. As in RumourEval 2017 we provided a dataset of dubious posts and ensuing conversations in social media, annotated both for stance and veracity. The social media rumours stem from a variety of breaking news stories and the dataset is expanded to include Reddit as well as new Twitter posts. There were two concrete tasks; rumour stance prediction and rumour verification, which we present in detail along with results achieved by participants. We received 22 system submissions (a 70{\%} increase from RumourEval 2017) many of which used state-of-the-art methodology to tackle the challenges involved.",

Rapid progression in image, video, and natural language generative models has only exacerbated this situation and intensified our need for an effective defense mechanism. While existing approaches have been proposed to defend against neural fake news, they are generally constrained to the very limited setting where articles only have text and metadata such as the title and authors. In this paper, we introduce the more realistic and challenging task of defending against machine-generated news that also includes images and captions. To identify the possible weaknesses that adversaries can exploit, we create a NeuralNews dataset which is comprised of 4 different types of generated articles as well as conduct a series of human user study experiments based on this dataset. Coupled with providing a relatively effective approach based on detecting visual-semantic inconsistencies, the valuable insights gleaned from our user study experiments and, consequently, this paper will serve as an effective first line of defense and a valuable reference for future work in defending against machine-generated disinformation.",

  abstract = 	 {Several recent end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) models enabling single-stage training and parallel sampling have been proposed, but their sample quality does not match that of two-stage TTS systems. In this work, we present a parallel end-to-end TTS method that generates more natural sounding audio than current two-stage models. Our method adopts variational inference augmented with normalizing flows and an adversarial training process, which improves the expressive power of generative modeling. We also propose a stochastic duration predictor to synthesize speech with diverse rhythms from input text. With the uncertainty modeling over latent variables and the stochastic duration predictor, our method expresses the natural one-to-many relationship in which a text input can be spoken in multiple ways with different pitches and rhythms. A subjective human evaluation (mean opinion score, or MOS) on the LJ Speech, a single speaker dataset, shows that our method outperforms the best publicly available TTS systems and achieves a MOS comparable to ground truth.}

Among different types of deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks have been most extensively studied. Leveraging on the rapid growth in the amount of the annotated data and the great improvements in the strengths of graphics processor units, the research on convolutional neural networks has been emerged swiftly and achieved state-of-the-art results on various tasks. In this paper, we provide a broad survey of the recent advances in convolutional neural networks. We detailize the improvements of CNN on different aspects, including layer design, activation function, loss function, regularization, optimization and fast computation. Besides, we also introduce various applications of convolutional neural networks in computer vision, speech and natural language processing.}

abstract = {Automatic speaker verification (ASV) is one of the most natural and convenient means of biometric person recognition. Unfortunately, just like all other biometric systems, ASV is vulnerable to spoofing, also referred to as “presentation attacks.” These vulnerabilities are generally unacceptable and call for spoofing countermeasures or “presentation attack detection” systems. In addition to impersonation, ASV systems are vulnerable to replay, speech synthesis, and voice conversion attacks. The ASVspoof challenge initiative was created to foster research on anti-spoofing and to provide common platforms for the assessment and comparison of spoofing countermeasures. The first edition, ASVspoof 2015, focused upon the study of countermeasures for detecting of text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) and voice conversion (VC) attacks. The second edition, ASVspoof 2017, focused instead upon replay spoofing attacks and countermeasures. The ASVspoof 2019 edition is the first to consider all three spoofing attack types within a single challenge. While they originate from the same source database and same underlying protocol, they are explored in two specific use case scenarios. Spoofing attacks within a logical access (LA) scenario are generated with the latest speech synthesis and voice conversion technologies, including state-of-the-art neural acoustic and waveform model techniques. Replay spoofing attacks within a physical access (PA) scenario are generated through carefully controlled simulations that support much more revealing analysis than possible previously. Also new to the 2019 edition is the use of the tandem detection cost function metric, which reflects the impact of spoofing and countermeasures on the reliability of a fixed ASV system. This paper describes the database design, protocol, spoofing attack implementations, and baseline ASV and countermeasure results. It also describes a human assessment on spoofed data in logical access. It was demonstrated that the spoofing data in the ASVspoof 2019 database have varied degrees of perceived quality and similarity to the target speakers, including spoofed data that cannot be differentiated from bona fide utterances even by human subjects. It is expected that the ASVspoof 2019 database, with its varied coverage of different types of spoofing data, could further foster research on anti-spoofing.}

abstract = {While biometric authentication has advanced significantly in recent years, evidence shows the technology can be susceptible to malicious spoofing attacks. The research community has responded with dedicated countermeasures which aim to detect and deflect such attacks. Even if the literature shows that they can be effective, the problem is far from being solved; biometric systems remain vulnerable to spoofing. Despite a growing momentum to develop spoofing countermeasures for automatic speaker verification, now that the technology has matured sufficiently to support mass deployment in an array of diverse applications, greater effort will be needed in the future to ensure adequate protection against spoofing. This article provides a survey of past work and identifies priority research directions for the future. We summarise previous studies involving impersonation, replay, speech synthesis and voice conversion spoofing attacks and more recent efforts to develop dedicated countermeasures. The survey shows that future research should address the lack of standard datasets and the over-fitting of existing countermeasures to specific, known spoofing attacks.},

  abstract = 	 {Sequential models achieve state-of-the-art results in audio, visual and textual domains with respect to both estimating the data distribution and generating desired samples. Efficient sampling for this class of models at the cost of little to no loss in quality has however remained an elusive problem. With a focus on text-to-speech synthesis, we describe a set of general techniques for reducing sampling time while maintaining high output quality. We first describe a single-layer recurrent neural network, the WaveRNN, with a dual softmax layer that matches the quality of the state-of-the-art WaveNet model. The compact form of the network makes it possible to generate 24 kHz 16-bit audio 4 times faster than real time on a GPU. Secondly, we apply a weight pruning technique to reduce the number of weights in the WaveRNN. We find that, for a constant number of parameters, large sparse networks perform better than small dense networks and this relationship holds past sparsity levels of more than 96%. The small number of weights in a Sparse WaveRNN makes it possible to sample high-fidelity audio on a mobile phone CPU in real time. Finally, we describe a new dependency scheme for sampling that lets us trade a constant number of non-local, distant dependencies for the ability to generate samples in batches. The Batch WaveRNN produces 8 samples per step without loss of quality and offers orthogonal ways of further increasing sampling efficiency.}

    abstract = "We present BART, a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models. BART is trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and other recent pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising approaches, finding the best performance by both randomly shuffling the order of sentences and using a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa on GLUE and SQuAD, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 3.5 ROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a back-translation system for machine translation, with only target language pretraining. We also replicate other pretraining schemes within the BART framework, to understand their effect on end-task performance.",

In this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called XGBoost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},

               Accordingly, the researchers believe in the significance of
               enhancing the skills of advisers in teaching the language,
               providing ideas for managing the publication, and aiding them
               with innovative material. This study aimed to determine the
               extent of manifestation of teaching language skills relative to
               campus journalism. Moreover, it identified the challenges of
               campus paper advisers. Also, it developed digitized language
               activities for campus paper advisers. Parallel to this, it
               employed a descriptive method of research. Respondents were
               seventy-five (75) school paper advisers in Calatagan District.
               The statistical tools used were the weighted mean and Pearson
               correlation coefficient. Findings revealed that teachers' level
               of teaching the English language was moderately competent. Also,
               findings exposed the challenges of advisers such as performing
               journalism tasks due to ancillary works, language skills,
               journalistic style, and method. The digitized language
               activities were prepared to provide the teachers with venues of
               teaching language skills through activities and applications in
               various journalism tasks. Thus, it recommended additional
               journalism training and materials, and innovative tools focusing
               on the four language skills. Also, it suggested that a similar
               study may be accomplished to determine other activities that
               could enhance language skills and school paper advisors.

abstract = {There is worldwide concern over false news and the possibility that it can influence political, economic, and social well-being. To understand how false news spreads, Vosoughi et al. used a data set of rumor cascades on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. About 126,000 rumors were spread by ∼3 million people. False news reached more people than the truth; the top 1\% of false news cascades diffused to between 1000 and 100,000 people, whereas the truth rarely diffused to more than 1000 people. Falsehood also diffused faster than the truth. The degree of novelty and the emotional reactions of recipients may be responsible for the differences observed. Science, this issue p. 1146 A large-scale analysis of tweets reveals that false rumors spread further and faster than the truth. We investigated the differential diffusion of all of the verified true and false news stories distributed on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. The data comprise ~126,000 stories tweeted by ~3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98\% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.}}

Grinberg et al. analyzed Twitter data by matching Twitter accounts to specific voters to determine who was exposed to fake news, who spread fake news, and how fake news interacted with factual news (see the Perspective by Ruths). Fake news accounted for nearly 6\% of all news consumption, but it was heavily concentrated—only 1\% of users were exposed to 80\% of fake news, and 0.1\% of users were responsible for sharing 80\% of fake news. Interestingly, fake news was most concentrated among conservative voters. Science, this issue p. 374; see also p. 348 A small proportion of voters share and are exposed to the majority of online fake news. The spread of fake news on social media became a public concern in the United States after the 2016 presidential election. We examined exposure to and sharing of fake news by registered voters on Twitter and found that engagement with fake news sources was extremely concentrated. Only 1\% of individuals accounted for 80\% of fake news source exposures, and 0.1\% accounted for nearly 80\% of fake news sources shared. Individuals most likely to engage with fake news sources were conservative leaning, older, and highly engaged with political news. A cluster of fake news sources shared overlapping audiences on the extreme right, but for people across the political spectrum, most political news exposure still came from mainstream media outlets.}}

abstract = {Emotion plays an important role in detecting fake news online. When leveraging emotional signals, the existing methods focus on exploiting the emotions of news contents that conveyed by the publishers (i.e., publisher emotion). However, fake news often evokes high-arousal or activating emotions of people, so the emotions of news comments aroused in the crowd (i.e., social emotion) should not be ignored. Furthermore, it remains to be explored whether there exists a relationship between publisher emotion and social emotion (i.e., dual emotion), and how the dual emotion appears in fake news. In this paper, we verify that dual emotion is distinctive between fake and real news and propose Dual Emotion Features&nbsp;to represent dual emotion and the relationship between them for fake news detection. Further, we exhibit that our proposed features can be easily plugged into existing fake news detectors as an enhancement. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (one in English and the others in Chinese) show that our proposed feature set: 1) outperforms the state-of-the-art task-related emotional features; 2) can be well compatible with existing fake news detectors and effectively improve the performance of detecting fake news.1 2},

In this work, we propose an annotated dataset of {\mbox{$\approx$}} 50K news that can be used for building automated fake news detection systems for a low resource language like Bangla. Additionally, we provide an analysis of the dataset and develop a benchmark system with state of the art NLP techniques to identify Bangla fake news. To create this system, we explore traditional linguistic features and neural network based methods. We expect this dataset will be a valuable resource for building technologies to prevent the spreading of fake news and contribute in research with low resource languages.

abstract="Along with COVID-19 pandemic we are also fighting an `infodemic'. Fake news and rumors are rampant on social media. Believing in rumors can cause significant harm. This is further exacerbated at the time of a pandemic. To tackle this, we curate and release a manually annotated dataset of 10,700 social media posts and articles of real and fake news on COVID-19. We perform a binary classification task (real vs fake) and benchmark the annotated dataset with four machine learning baselines - Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We obtain the best performance of 93.32{\%} F1-score with SVM on the test set. The data and code is available at: https://github.com/parthpatwa/covid19-fake-news-dectection.",

abstract = {Fake news dissemination on COVID-19 has increased in recent months, and the factors that lead to the sharing of this misinformation is less well studied. Therefore, this paper describes the result of a Nigerian sample (n = 385) regarding the proliferation of fake news on COVID-19. The fake news phenomenon was studied using the Uses and Gratification framework, which was extended by an “altruism” motivation. The data were analysed with Partial Least Squares (PLS) to determine the effects of six variables on the outcome of fake news sharing. Our results showed that altruism was the most significant factor that predicted fake news sharing of COVID-19. We also found that social media users’ motivations for information sharing, socialisation, information seeking and pass time predicted the sharing of false information about COVID-19. In contrast, no significant association was found for entertainment motivation. We concluded with some theoretical and practical implications.}

Many fake news datasets were constructed as resources to facilitate this task. Contemporary research focuses almost exclusively on the factuality aspect of the news. However, this aspect alone is insufficient to explain {``}fake news,{''} which is a complex phenomenon that involves a wide range of issues. To fully understand the nature of each instance of fake news, it is important to observe it from various perspectives, such as the intention of the false news disseminator, the harmfulness of the news to our society, and the target of the news. We propose a novel annotation scheme with fine-grained labeling based on detailed investigations of existing fake news datasets to capture these various aspects of fake news. Using the annotation scheme, we construct and publish the first Japanese fake news dataset. The annotation scheme is expected to provide an in-depth understanding of fake news. We plan to build datasets for both Japanese and other languages using our scheme. Our Japanese dataset is published at https://hkefka385.github.io/dataset/fakenews-japanese/.",

abstract={The COVID-19 crisis has revealed structural failures in governance and coordination on a global scale. With related policy interventions dependent on verifiable evidence, pandemics require governments to not only consider the input of experts but also ensure that science is translated for public understanding. However, misinformation and fake news, including content shared through social media, compromise the efficacy of evidence-based policy interventions and undermine the credibility of scientific expertise with potentially longer-term consequences. We introduce a formal mathematical model to understand factors influencing the behavior of social media users when encountering fake news. The model illustrates that direct efforts by social media platforms and governments, along with informal pressure from social networks, can reduce the likelihood that users who encounter fake news embrace and further circulate it. This study has implications at a practical level for crisis response in politically fractious settings and at a theoretical level for research about post-truth and the construction of fact.},

abstract={In the modern era of computing, the news ecosystem has transformed from old traditional print media to social media outlets. Social media platforms allow us to consume news much faster, with less restricted editing results in the spread of fake news at an incredible pace and scale. In recent researches, many useful methods for fake news detection employ sequential neural networks to encode news content and social context-level information where the text sequence was analyzed in a unidirectional way. Therefore, a bidirectional training approach is a priority for modelling the relevant information of fake news that is capable of improving the classification performance with the ability to capture semantic and long-distance dependencies in sentences. In this paper, we propose a BERT-based (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) deep learning approach (FakeBERT) by combining different parallel blocks of the single-layer deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) having different kernel sizes and filters with the BERT. Such a combination is useful to handle ambiguity, which is the greatest challenge to natural language understanding. Classification results demonstrate that our proposed model (FakeBERT) outperforms the existing models with an accuracy of 98.90{\%}.},

abstract = {As news reading on social media becomes more and more popular, fake news becomes a major issue concerning the public and government. The fake news can take advantage of multimedia content to mislead readers and get dissemination, which can cause negative effects or even manipulate the public events. One of the unique challenges for fake news detection on social media is how to identify fake news on newly emerged events. Unfortunately, most of the existing approaches can hardly handle this challenge, since they tend to learn event-specific features that can not be transferred to unseen events. In order to address this issue, we propose an end-to-end framework named Event Adversarial Neural Network (EANN), which can derive event-invariant features and thus benefit the detection of fake news on newly arrived events. It consists of three main components: the multi-modal feature extractor, the fake news detector, and the event discriminator. The multi-modal feature extractor is responsible for extracting the textual and visual features from posts. It cooperates with the fake news detector to learn the discriminable representation for the detection of fake news. The role of event discriminator is to remove the event-specific features and keep shared features among events. Extensive experiments are conducted on multimedia datasets collected from Weibo and Twitter. The experimental results show our proposed EANN model can outperform the state-of-the-art methods, and learn transferable feature representations.},

The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT’s use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.}

One would expect a straightforward combination of both in a pipeline to have additive performance gain. In this paper, we discover otherwise and that popular reranker cannot fully exploit the improved retrieval result.

We expand the analysis to present three tests based on mathematical, semantic (that is, the Turing Test), and ethical questions and show that GPT-3 is not designed to pass any of them. This is a reminder that GPT-3 does not do what it is not supposed to do, and that any interpretation of GPT-3 as the beginning of the emergence of a general form of artificial intelligence is merely uninformed science fiction.

abstract={We introduce, analyze and demonstrate a recursive hierarchical generalization of the widely used hidden Markov models, which we name Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models (HHMM). Our model is motivated by the complex multi-scale structure which appears in many natural sequences, particularly in language, handwriting and speech. We seek a systematic unsupervised approach to the modeling of such structures. By extending the standard Baum-Welch (forward-backward) algorithm, we derive an efficient procedure for estimating the model parameters from unlabeled data. We then use the trained model for automatic hierarchical parsing of observation sequences. We describe two applications of our model and its parameter estimation procedure. In the first application we show how to construct hierarchical models of natural English text. In these models different levels of the hierarchy correspond to structures on different length scales in the text. In the second application we demonstrate how HHMMs can be used to automatically identify repeated strokes that represent combination of letters in cursive handwriting.},

(2) If so, what phrases in the sentence come from the original document? and (3) From where in the document do the phrases come? Solving the decomposition problem can lead to better text generation techniques for summarization. Decomposition can also provide large training and testing corpora for extraction-based summarizers.

abstract={This paper examines the ethical solutions raised in response to OpenAI's language model Generative Pre-trained Transformer-3 (GPT-3) a year and a half from its release. I argue that hype and fear about GPT-3, even within the Natural Language Processing (NLP) industry and AI ethics, have often been underpinned by technologically deterministic perspectives. These perspectives emphasise the autonomy of the language model rather than the autonomy of human actors in AI systems. I highlight the existence of deterministic perspectives in the current AI discourse (which range from technological utopianism to dystopianism), with a specific focus on the two issues of: (1) GPT-3's potential intentional misuse for manipulation and (2) unintentional harm caused by bias. In response, I find that a contextual approach to GPT-3, which is centred upon wider ecologies of societal harm and benefit, human autonomy, and human values, illuminates practical solutions to concerns about manipulation and bias. Additionally, although OpenAI's newest 2022 language model InstructGPT represents a small step in reducing toxic language and aligning GPT-3 with user intent, it does not provide any compelling solutions to manipulation or bias. Therefore, I argue that solutions to address these issues must focus on organisational settings as a precondition for ethical decision-making in AI, and high-quality curated datasets as a precondition for less harmful language model outputs.},

We first assess the bias and realism of zero-shot generated advertisements and compare them to real-world advertisements. We then evaluate prompt-engineering and fine-tuning as debiasing methods. We find that prompt-engineering with diversity-encouraging prompts gives no significant improvement to bias, nor realism. Conversely, fine-tuning, especially on unbiased real advertisements, can improve realism and reduce bias.",

abstract={While the problems of disinformation, misinformation and propaganda are not new, certain aspects of modern technology and communications appear to be contributing to a rapid polarization and democratic deterioration in the U.S. and abroad. The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation's Madison Initiative focuses on making democracy and its institutions  especially Congress  more effective in a polarized age, and is currently exploring opportunities to address the disinformation/propaganda problem. An analysis conducted in 2017 for the initiative explores whether a larger, more sustained investment from the foundation is warranted. To examine the problem and potential philanthropic interventions, researchers conducted interviews with leaders from academia, digital media platforms (both current and former employees), think tanks, and civil society organizations. Informants identify many actors seeking solutions to the current disinformation/propaganda problem, with most funders focused on improving the quality of journalism, fact-checking, or news literacy. They identify several elements germane to understanding the problem, including: <ul> <li>the democratization of information creation and distribution;</li> <li>the socialization of information sharing;</li> <li>the atomization of news away from reputable brands to individuals;</li> <li>the anonymity of content creators and distributors;</li> <li>the increasing level of content personalization; and</li> <li>The sovereignty of the technology platforms.</li> </ul> All of these factors combine to elevate the internet and, in particular, social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, increasingly Instagram, and others) as the most critical point for intervention. The authors outline options for investing in a research agenda related to popular social platforms, where lack of information about the problem, how technology impacts it, and the efficacy of proposed solution creates a hurdle to crafting effective interventions.},

Second, we apply zero-shot in-context semantic reasoning techniques with cloze-style prompts to discern genuine from deceptive posts and news articles. In our extensive experiments, we observe GPT-3.5-turbo{'}s zero-shot superiority for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, where GPT-3.5-turbo consistently achieved accuracy at 68-72{\%}, unlike the decline observed in previous customized and fine-tuned disinformation detectors.

To support this case study we construct a new dataset PUBHEALTH of 11.8K claims accompanied by journalist crafted, gold standard explanations (i.e., judgments) to support the fact-check labels for claims. We explore two tasks: veracity prediction and explanation generation. We also define and evaluate, with humans and computationally, three coherence properties of explanation quality.

abstract = {Abstract Nowadays, social media platforms such as Twitter have become a popular medium for people to spread and consume news because of their easy access and the rapid proliferation of news. However, the credibility of the news posted on these platforms has become a significant issue. In other words, written news that contains inaccurate information aiming to mislead readers has been rapidly disseminated on these platforms. In the literature, this news is called fake news. Detecting such news on social media platforms has become a challenging task. One of the main challenges is identifying useful information that is exploited as a way to detect fake news. A hybrid model comprising a recurrent neural network (RNN) and support vector machine (SVM) is incorporated to detect real and fake news. An RNN with bidirectional gated recurrent units was used to encode textual data, including news content and comments, to numerical feature vectors. The encoded features were fed to an SVM with radial basis function kernel to classify the given input of real and fake news. Experiments on the real-world dataset yield encouraging results and demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

While important, however, we argue that a critical missing piece of the study be the explainability of such detection, i.e., why a particular piece of news is detected as fake. In this paper, therefore, we study the explainable detection of fake news. We develop a sentence-comment co-attention sub-network to exploit both news contents and user comments to jointly capture explainable top-k check-worthy sentences and user comments for fake news detection. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets and demonstrate that the proposed method not only significantly outperforms 7 state-of-the-art fake news detection methods by at least 5.33\% in F1-score, but also (concurrently) identifies top-k user comments that explain why a news piece is fake, better than baselines by 28.2\% in NDCG and 30.7\% in Precision.},

abstract = {Fake news spread widely on social media in various domains, which lead to real-world threats in many aspects like politics, disasters, and finance. Most existing approaches focus on single-domain fake news detection (SFND), which leads to unsatisfying performance when these methods are applied to multi-domain fake news detection. As an emerging field, multi-domain fake news detection (MFND) is increasingly attracting attention. However, data distributions, such as word frequency and propagation patterns, vary from domain to domain, namely domain shift. Facing the challenge of serious domain shift, existing fake news detection techniques perform poorly for multi-domain scenarios. Therefore, it is demanding to design a specialized model for MFND. In this paper, we first design a benchmark of fake news dataset for MFDN with domain label annotated, namely Weibo21, which consists of 4,488 fake news and 4,640 real news from 9 different domains. We further propose an effective Multi-domain Fake News Detection Model (MDFEND) by utilizing domain gate to aggregate multiple representations extracted by a mixture of experts. The experiments show that MDFEND can significantly improve the performance of multi-domain fake news detection. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/kennqiang/MDFEND-Weibo21.},

Considering the problematic consequences that the COVID-19 fake-news have brought, the scientific community has put effort to tackle it. To contribute to this fight against the infodemic, we aim to achieve a robust model for the COVID-19 fake-news detection task proposed at CONSTRAINT 2021 (FakeNews-19) by taking two separate approaches: 1) fine-tuning transformers based language models with robust loss functions and 2) removing harmful training instances through influence calculation. We further evaluate the robustness of our models by evaluating on different COVID-19 misinformation test set (Tweets-19) to understand model generalization ability. With the first approach, we achieve 98.13{\%} for weighted F1 score (W-F1) for the shared task, whereas 38.18{\%} W-F1 on the Tweets-19 highest. On the contrary, by performing influence data cleansing, our model with 99{\%} cleansing percentage can achieve 54.33{\%} W-F1 score on Tweets-19 with a trade-off. By evaluating our models on two COVID-19 fake-news test sets, we suggest the importance of model generalization ability in this task to step forward to tackle the COVID-19 fake-news problem in online social media platforms.",

abstract = {Fact-checking is one of the effective solutions in fighting online misinformation. However, traditional fact-checking is a process requiring scarce expert human resources, and thus does not scale well on social media because of the continuous flow of new content to be checked. Methods based on crowdsourcing have been proposed to tackle this challenge, as they can scale with a smaller cost, but, while they have shown to be feasible, have always been studied in controlled environments. In this work, we study the first large-scale effort of crowdsourced fact-checking deployed in practice, started by Twitter with the Birdwatch program. Our analysis shows that crowdsourcing may be an effective fact-checking strategy in some settings, even comparable to results obtained by human experts, but does not lead to consistent, actionable results in others. We processed 11.9k tweets verified by the Birdwatch program and report empirical evidence of i) differences in how the crowd and experts select content to be fact-checked, ii) how the crowd and the experts retrieve different resources to fact-check, and iii) the edge the crowd shows in fact-checking scalability and efficiency as compared to expert checkers.},

In addition, it also explored how exposure to different message modalities (i.e., text, image, and video) may exacerbate the recall and recollection of news content, especially when presented with purposely misleading information. An online experiment (n = 568) using manipulated mock news articles was conducted to gauge participants' content memory for participants exposed to either factually correct or disinformation news content. Findings showcase that while there is no significant difference in content memory scores between those exposed to disinformation and factually correct news, partisans might be more tempted to purposely remember story details that support their party regardless of whether those details are accurate. Moreover, while modality may help in aiding one's memory for information, other factors such as expectancy-violation should be integrated with existing multimedia learning theories when applying the cognitive processing logic of modality to news consumption.}

abstract = {The wide dissemination of fake news is increasingly threatening both individuals and society. Fake news detection aims to train a model on the past news and detect fake news of the future. Though great efforts have been made, existing fake news detection methods overlooked the unintended entity bias in the real-world data, which seriously influences models' generalization ability to future data. For example, 97\% of news pieces in 2010-2017 containing the entity 'Donald Trump' are real in our data, but the percentage falls down to merely 33\% in 2018. This would lead the model trained on the former set to hardly generalize to the latter, as it tends to predict news pieces about 'Donald Trump' as real for lower training loss. In this paper, we propose an entity debiasing framework (ENDEF) which generalizes fake news detection models to the future data by mitigating entity bias from a cause-effect perspective. Based on the causal graph among entities, news contents, and news veracity, we separately model the contribution of each cause (entities and contents) during training. In the inference stage, we remove the direct effect of the entities to mitigate entity bias. Extensive offline experiments on the English and Chinese datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can largely improve the performance of base fake news detectors, and online tests verify its superiority in practice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly improve the generalization ability of fake news detection models to the future data.

abstract = {The goal of text-to-text generation is to make machines express like a human in many applications such as conversation, summarization, and translation. It is one of the most important yet challenging tasks in natural language processing (NLP). Various neural encoder-decoder models have been proposed to achieve the goal by learning to map input text to output text. However, the input text alone often provides limited knowledge to generate the desired output, so the performance of text generation is still far from satisfaction in many real-world scenarios. To address this issue, researchers have considered incorporating (i) internal knowledge embedded in the input text and (ii) external knowledge from outside sources such as knowledge base and knowledge graph into the text generation system. This research topic is known as knowledge-enhanced text generation. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of the research on this topic over the past five years. The main content includes two parts: (i) general methods and architectures for integrating knowledge into text generation; (ii) specific techniques and applications according to different forms of knowledge data. This survey can have broad audiences, researchers and practitioners, in academia and industry.},

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, but whether and how LLMs could help with fake news detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the potential of LLMs in fake news detection. First, we conduct an empirical study and find that a sophisticated LLM such as GPT 3.5 could generally expose fake news and provide desirable multi-perspective rationales but still underperforms the basic SLM, fine-tuned BERT. Our subsequent analysis attributes such a gap to the LLM’s inability to select and integrate rationales properly to conclude. Based on these findings, we propose that current LLMs may not substitute fine-tuned SLMs in fake news detection but can be a good advisor for SLMs by providing multi-perspective instructive rationales. To instantiate this proposal, we design an adaptive rationale guidance network for fake news detection (ARG), in which SLMs selectively acquire insights on news analysis from the LLMs’ rationales. We further derive a rationale-free version of ARG by distillation, namely ARG-D, which services cost-sensitive scenarios without inquiring LLMs. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that ARG and ARG-D outperform three types of baseline methods, including SLM-based, LLM-based, and combinations of small and large language models.}, number={20}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Hu, Beizhe and Sheng, Qiang and Cao, Juan and Shi, Yuhui and Li, Yang and Wang, Danding and Qi, Peng}, year={2024}, month={Mar.}, pages={22105-22113} }

A common approach to this issue is developing detection models that rely on human annotations. However, the tasks required to build such models expose annotators to harmful and offensive content and may require significant time and cost to complete. Generative AI models have the potential to understand and detect harmful textual content. We used ChatGPT to investigate this potential and compared its performance with MTurker annotations for three frequently discussed concepts related to harmful textual content on social media: Hateful, Offensive, and Toxic (HOT). We designed five prompts to interact with ChatGPT and conducted four experiments eliciting HOT classifications. Our results show that ChatGPT can achieve an accuracy of approximately 80\% when compared to MTurker annotations. Specifically, the model displays a more consistent classification for non-HOT comments than HOT comments compared to human annotations. Our findings also suggest that ChatGPT classifications align with the provided HOT definitions. However, ChatGPT classifies “hateful” and “offensive” as subsets of “toxic.” Moreover, the choice of prompts used to interact with ChatGPT impacts its performance. Based on these insights, our study provides several meaningful implications for employing ChatGPT to detect HOT content, particularly regarding the reliability and consistency of its performance, its understanding and reasoning of the HOT concept, and the impact of prompts on its performance. Overall, our study provides guidance on the potential of using generative AI models for moderating large volumes of user-generated textual content on social media.},

However, alongside these advancements, they have also introduced potential threats. One critical concern is the misuse of LLMs by disinformation spreaders, leveraging these models to generate highly persuasive yet misleading content that challenges the disinformation detection system. This work aims to address this issue by answering three research questions: (1) To what extent can the current disinformation detection technique reliably detect LLM-generated disinformation? (2) If traditional techniques prove less effective, can LLMs themself be exploited to serve as a robust defense against advanced disinformation? and, (3) Should both these strategies falter, what novel approaches can be proposed to counter this burgeoning threat effectively? A holistic exploration for the formation and detection of disinformation is conducted to foster this line of research. }

This phenomenon impacts ideologies, politics and public health. The 2016 US presidential elections, the Brexit referendum, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war have been ideal scenarios for the spreading of fake news and hoaxes, due to the massive dissemination of information. Assuming that fake news mixes reliable and unreliable information, we propose RUN-AS (Reliable and Unreliable Annotation Scheme), a fine-grained annotation scheme that enables the labelling of the structural parts and essential content elements of a news item and their classification into Reliable and Unreliable. This annotation proposal aims to detect disinformation patterns in text and to classify the global reliability of news. To this end, a dataset in Spanish was built and manually annotated with RUN-AS and several experiments using this dataset were conducted to validate the annotation scheme by using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms.

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly being used for various use cases, including text content generation at scale. Although detection methods for such AI-generated text exist already, we investigate ChatGPT's performance as a detector on such AI-generated text, inspired by works that use ChatGPT as a data labeler or annotator. We evaluate the zeroshot performance of ChatGPT in the task of human-written vs. AI-generated text detection, and perform experiments on publicly available datasets. We empirically investigate if ChatGPT is symmetrically effective in detecting AI-generated or human-written text. Our findings provide insight on how ChatGPT and similar LLMs may be leveraged in automated detection pipelines by simply focusing on solving a specific aspect of the problem and deriving the rest from that solution. All code and data is available at https://github.com/AmritaBh/ChatGPT-as-Detector.},

    abstract = "Short video fake news detection is crucial for combating the spread of misinformation. Current detection methods tend to aggregate features from individual modalities into multimodal features, overlooking the implicit opinions and the evolving nature of opinions across modalities. In this paper, we mine implicit opinions within short video news and promote the evolution of both explicit and implicit opinions across all modalities. Specifically, we design a prompt template to mine implicit opinions regarding the credibility of news from the textual component of videos. Additionally, we employ a diffusion model that encourages the interplay among diverse modal opinions, including those extracted through our implicit opinion prompts. Experimental results on a publicly available dataset for short video fake news detection demonstrate the superiority of our model over state-of-the-art methods.",
